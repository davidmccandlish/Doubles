# Doubles project

This repository contains the code and input files needed to replicate results from the manuscript "Less frequent but more numerous: how rare mutational changes contribute to adaptation in finite mutational landscapes" by Klug, et al (in progress). This includes the code for generating all the figures. The main sections are 

* Code
  * SimpleModel. The simple model without populations
  * WFModel. The WrightFisher model
  * Other. Methods and figures related to counting up and representing access to sequence space, assigning single/double/triple state to empirical data, and estimating alpha from available sources
* Data_P53. Input file with data on the TP53 case
* Data_TEM1. Input file with data on the TEM1 case

Before attempting to use these materials, please read the relevant descriptions in Methods.
